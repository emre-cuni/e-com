* The project has two types of users. These are "customer" and "admin".
* Admin can only save products to database.
* In the Customer section, there are user registration and user login features.
* The desired product in the project can be added to the cart.
* Clicking on the listed product opens the product details. And when double-clicking on an empty place on the screen, the description page is closed.
* When the "Complete shopping" stage is reached, a verification code is sent to the registered e-mail address when the user correctly enters the card information registered in the database.
* If the entered code is matched with the sent code, the shopping completed message is displayed and the software is closed.
